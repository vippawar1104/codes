Average Calculator Script - Hacktoberfest 2024
Welcome to the Average Calculator Script project! This is a simple Python script designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers. It has been purposefully created with some issues to encourage contributions for Hacktoberfest 2024.
Description
This Python script defines a function get_average that calculates the average of a list of numbers. It iterates through the list, sums the values, and then divides the total by the number of elements in the list. The script includes test cases to demonstrate its functionality.
Issues to Address
We are looking for contributors to help improve the script by addressing the following issues:
Division by Zero: The script currently does not handle empty lists, which results in a division by zero error.
Inefficient Looping: The use of range(len(numbers)) for iteration can be optimized.
Unnecessary Initializations: There are opportunities to streamline the code by removing unnecessary initializations.
Lack of Input Validation: The script does not validate the input list to ensure it contains numeric values.
